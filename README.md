From the book "Sams Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours":

"Computer programming with Java is easier than it looks. Iâ€™m not supposed to tell you that because thousands of programmers have used their Java skills to get high-paying jobs in software development, web application programming, and mobile app creation. The last thing any programmer wants is for the boss to know that anyone who has
persistence and a little free time can learn this language, the most popular programming language in use today."
